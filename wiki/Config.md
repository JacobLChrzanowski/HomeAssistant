## What is a locale?
Locales are basically rooms but meant to give you the option of having more than one configurable zone in a room. You might have a locale for the ceiling lights, and another for your desk light. This was the answer to avoiding Home Assistant's rooms which are great for locating lights, but for which you otherwise need to create light groups for. The other reason locales are useful are for when you don't want all the lights shining the same and want to create distinct patterns.

Maybe this wasn't thought through all the way. Excellent! Let's keep rolling.
